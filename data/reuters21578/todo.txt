-- straight forward clustering, k-means like or other.

		Run core clustering on more parameters, neglect small sized clusters
		LOF (outlier detection), reverse it for core extraction
		Dynamic neighborhood threshold vs static thresholds
		More complex similarity (concept/ontology)

-----

-- Run typical clustering first, get cores of each cluster, and extract cluster concepts from its cores (term coocurrence)
